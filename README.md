I am a first-generation student majoring in Computer and Systems Engineering at the Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola. Ever since I rediscovered my career, Iâ€™ve had a passion for making an impact in the world through computer science. Hence, I promote computer science student events focused on treating computer science and software engineering related topics, promoting software engineering application, and teaching software engineering practical skills and computer theory topics.
